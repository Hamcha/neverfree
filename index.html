    <game-section title="Description">
    <p>Neverfree <i>(temporary name)</i> is a top-down exploration game where
    you play as the last of your species: A pony.<br />
    Following a ghost, you start adventuring into an endless forest full of
    monsters and misteries that will uncover your past.</p>
    <p>The game will feature various dungeouns and ways to approach and defeat
    enemies and the character will receive upgrades throughout the game that will
    unlock other part of the map, like in many metroidvania games</p>

    <game-section title="History">
    <p>Neverfree was initially a prototype built with Multimedia Fusion 2, although
    given the requirements and flexibility required by the project it was soon
    been rebuilt in Unity.</p>
    <p>Neverfree went into hiatus for a year until I decided to pick it up again,
    and also decided to make it open source on Github.</p>
